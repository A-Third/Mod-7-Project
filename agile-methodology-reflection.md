## Reflection Response
The team's communication process was mostly online because Andii was sick for the majority of project week. We made sure to connect by having a virtual daily stand-up meeting and joining in a virtual working space to resolve challenges. Our team also had daily stand-downs where we communicated our action plan for next day.

America was the Scrum master and Project Manager by creating daily action plans based off off the tickets. We were able to make sure we delegated the tasks in our project for separation of concerns. Essentially, each team member was response for their respective components. 

Our team created the timeline for reaching MVP based off of our Scrum board. America used `useState` and `useContext` along with two fetches on the first day. Andii use `Routes`, `Route`, `Link`, and `useNavigate` along with one fetch on the second day. This prioritization accommodated Andii's sickness.

Our group had strong communication, prioritization, and delegations of tasks while accommodating Andii's sickness. We were able to finish the project on-time because of our strong project management skills.
